          Artists in Resonance, casually known on campus as AiR!, is the premiere independent co-ed
          a cappella group based out of the University of California, Berkeley. From our humble beginnings
          in 1987, We now have fourteen amazing performers, performing every Monday at noon underneath Sather
          Gate on campus. Our repertoire includes self-arranged pieces, everything from alternative rock and
          hip-hop to traditional fight songs and Top 40 hits.
          <br>
          During the school year, you can find us singing on Sproul Plaza, but donâ€™t be surprised if you also
          see us at the Telegraph Street Fair, Jack London Square, or even Santa Cruz! We also perform all over
          California at numerous events. We have made appearances at the Annual Big Sing-Off (UC Berkeley/Stanford),
          the California A Cappella Festival (UC Los Angeles), the West Coast A Cappella Showcase (UC Berkeley),
          and the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.
          <br>
          Each semester, we hold several concerts on campus at UC Berkeley. Check our website to stay updated
          with concert dates and much more.
